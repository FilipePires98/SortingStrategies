# Sorting Strategies
A Study on the Most Famous Sorting Algorithms

## Description

The goal of this project is to study different sorting strategies in terms of computational complexity and execution time.
Our focus was on their behavior throughout time and according to the size of the data set to be sorted.

The implemented algorithms are:
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Shell Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Rank Sort
- Shaker Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort

The results suggest that, in most cases, Quick Sort presents the best results.
